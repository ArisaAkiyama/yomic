All notable changes to **Yomic** will be documented in this file.

## [1.3.0] - Major Update & UI Overhaul

Update Details：
◆ Add the ability to backup and restore user data, including library, read history, and app settings, into a single secure `.yomic` file.
◆ Add DNS over HTTPS configuration in Settings with multiple providers (Google DNS set as default) to improve connectivity and bypass restrictions.
◆ Improve the overall UI of the Settings page by introducing a more modern, premium aesthetic with rounded borders, soft shadows, and clean layouts.
◆ Improve the Sidebar Navigation by implementing a dedicated `SidebarBtn` style featuring a Windows 11 Fluent UI style pill selection indicator.
◆ Improve the layout and alignment of the "About" section in the Settings page, ensuring the "Check for Updates" and version number display (`v1.3.0`) are perfectly positioned.
◆ Fix a widespread visual bug where standard navigation buttons (like Back, Refresh, and Reader Next/Prev) incorrectly inherited a square gray/blue hover box from the Sidebar.
◆ Fix a bug where clicking on Fluent Icons inside buttons would sometimes trigger text selection, causing a solid blue background box to appear.
◆ Fix button border radius inheritance in `ReaderView`, ensuring all small icon buttons return to their intended smooth, circular hover effects.
◆ Fix the layout alignment and spacing logic for the backup data action buttons within `SettingsView.axaml`.
◆ Improve localization and consistency of button states across Dark and Light mode themes.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **New Extension**: Added support for `maid.my.id` source.
- **Infinite Scroll**: Implemented automatic infinite scroll behavior to the "Latest" section of WestManga.

### Changed
- **Server Startup Performance**: Greatly optimized the local Node.js server startup speed (bypassed long installation checks and reduced port timeout delays, providing near-instant Online status).
